# Welcome to LSC SCAN
LSC Scan is a static security analysis tool (Static Analysis Security Testing – SAST) designed specifically to analyze Laravel 12 codebases. It acts as an automated audit assistant that scans source files locally to identify risky coding patterns that may lead to security vulnerabilities. The main goal of this tool is to detect common issues such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and environment configuration mistakes that often occur during the application development lifecycle.
